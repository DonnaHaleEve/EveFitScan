# README #

This is the standalone Eve Online fit scan tool.
I created it to simplify ship fit scanning.

Some code was borrowed from
https://bitbucket.org/shitanko_eve/evescanner
and
https://bitbucket.org/viktorielucilla/evescanner-net4

### What is this repository for? ###

* Scan ship, get its full fit, estimate EHP versus different ammunition. Post this information for everyone to see.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Requires Visual Studio 2013, .net 4.5

### Who do I talk to? ###

* GSF forum or ingame: Donna Hale
* Or even better, just create an issue or a pull request here
